# To-do List:

Here is a list of what needs to be done:

Short-term goals:
- Create a system specifically for rarity effects.
- Nerf and rework any annoying vanilla additions.

Mid-term goals:
- Progress on the Eden subworld and its related content.

Long-term goals:
- Many of the generic content, obviously.
- Support any difficulty modes from Calamity, Infernum, and Fargo's Souls.
- Support any modded bosses (especially ones from Thorium and Avalon) to enhance their overall difficulty if needed.
- Rework all of the vanilla bosses (currently revamping Lunatic Cultist as a demonstration).
